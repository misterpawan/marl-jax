# Sequential Social Dilemma Games
Adapted from: https://github.com/eugenevinitsky/sequential_social_dilemma_games


## Changes
- We have updated the code to only depend on gym, numpy, pygame, opencv and matplotlib
- The dependency on ray/rllib and pettingzoo has been removed
- Also added a dm_lab wrapper around the original environments to be compatible with our repo
